1. Compartmentalize yourself -- compartmentalization is the act of limiting access to information through a need-to-know basis (E.G: Keeping your accounts separated from each other and telling no one that doesn't need to know).

2. Online life should be completely separate from offline life.

3. Keep your profiles limited, set security and privacy settings as high as possible – less information out there, less information people can find.

4. Always have an escape plan and a contingency plan – keep things short and quick, if your account is suddenly too popular too fast, find a way to remove it without anyone cataloging.

5. Grab this dossier from here (https://pastebin.com/MRWPBWwE) and make two dossiers – one for the information you can remember, the other for information you’ve found.

6. Self-dox by doing the following (Note: Self dox is not doxing yourself but finding your information and working to expunge it, never posting it for others to see).

7. Look at what information you’ve found, compare each dossier to each other to see what you’ve missed and found.

8. Never delete old email accounts, switch any accounts linked to them to another email address and let the email sit for a year. After a year, delete.

9. Delete your information once you crosscheck the dossiers with each other and ensure you’ve found all your information (Remember: Don’t post any of this publicly, this is only for you to go through).-
Remember the 1 month rule
A. Wait a month before deleting an account.
B. Within that month, hide and/or delete all comments that you can that aren’t yours.
C. Modify and change everything that you can.
D. Any editable text should be randomized (E.G: wodegnoi2n402)
E. Images should be changed to a blank or solid color image.
F. Videos should be changed to a solid color or static video.
G. All CSS and HTML, that’s editable, should be wiped out.
H. Change the e-mail address used to register the account with something else.
I. Check your e-mail addresses against Have I Been PWNED to ensure nothing has been compromised.
J. Repeat the above steps for each account and e-mail address to be deleted.

10. Before deleting an account, check your accounts against the internet archive @ archive.org.

11. If archives exist, send an email to info@archive.org and request you’d wish your archives would be removed for privacy reasons. To ensure they know you’re the account holder, take a screen cap while logged into your account(s). This is to show them you are the owner and have access to the account.

To give people the tools to keep themselves safe and secure.

=================================================

What is OPSEC

OPSEC is a term that, like many others used in cybersec, originated in the U.S. military. It originally meant whether or not a friendly’s actions could be observed by the enemy and if what they observed and the information obtained could be useful to them (the enemy), and then execute selected measures that eliminate and/or reduces the enemy’s possible exploitation of the critical information that they’ve obtained.

OPSEC, though, is also about protecting minuscule pieces of information that, when grouped, could be used to form a bigger picture of things. Similar to removing and preventing “meta-data,” OPSEC is about taking several preventative measures to ensure no-one is listening, spying or simply happen upon information that you, yourself, carelessly given away.

In the more modern use of the term, it now includes protecting information from not only unfriendly eyes, but also preventing industrial espionage, hackers, crackers, law enforcement, social engineering, and also mass surveillance catching or finding the aforementioned information.

This is why many now state that if you’re not using the same protection and guidelines as criminals and terrorists to protect yourself and your information, then you’re doing it wrong.

Afterword
There’s so much to discuss when on the topic of OPSEC, however due to the nature of the Paranoid’s Bible and the literature it publishes… we’d only be rehashing what’ll be discussed and explained in other guides/PDFs. So as a way to touch upon OPSEC without rehashing several things from other guides/PDFs, we decided to give a quick bit of information that many amateur privacy enthusiasts need to know.
